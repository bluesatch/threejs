SHADOWS

core shadows/drop shadows

core shadows are already working with the light

drop shadows will show on plane

Three.js will do a render for each light supporting shadows 
Those renders will simulate what the light sees as if it was a camera

During these light renders, a MeshDepthMaterial replaces all meshes materials

shadow maps => textures of what the lights can see 

How to activate shadows 
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true

Only the following lights support shadows 
    PointLight
    DirectionalLight
    SpotLight

Different types of algorithms can be applied to shadow maps
    THREE.BasicShadowMap => Very performant but lousy quality
    THREE.PCFShadowMap => Less performant but smoother edges(default)
    THREE.PCSSoftShadowMap => Less performant but even softer edges
    THREE.VSMShadowMap => Less performant, more constraints, cna have unexpected results
