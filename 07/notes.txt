Cameras

Camera class
Camera() creates a new Camera; not intended to be called directly; use PerspectiveCamera or OrthographicCamera

ArrayCamera => render the scene from multiple cameras on specific areas of the render 

StereoCamera => render the scene through two cameras that mimic the eyes to create a parallax effect

CubeCamera => 6 renders each one facing a different direction

OrthographicCamera renders the scene without perspective 

PerspectiveCamera => render the scene with perspective 

Custom Controls =>  see documentation
    using orbitControls => allows the camera to orbit around a target

When to use Built-in controls or custom?
    make sure they support all the features you need
