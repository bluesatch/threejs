Textures

images that will cover the surface of the geometries
    many types with many different effects

most used => door textures by Joao Paulo 

most simple one Color (Or albedo) 
Alpha texture => grayscale image white visible/black not visible

height (or displacement)

we will be moving vertices up and down 
will need enough subdivision

Normal => doesn't need subdivision

Ambient occlusion
    add fake shadows in crevices

metalness
    mostly for reflection

Roughnness
    in duo with metalness
    mostly for light dissipation

PBR Principles
    Physically Based Rendering
    Many techniques that tend to follow real-life directions to get realistic results
    Becoming the standard for realistic renders
    Many software, engines, and libraries are using it
