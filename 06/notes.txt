Animation is like doing stop motion
    Take a picture
    Move the object a bit mroe
    Take a picture
    etc.

Most screens run at 60 frames per seconds (FPS)

Animation must look the same regardless of the framerate

create function => window.requestAnimationFrame

The purpose of requestAnimationFrame is to call the function provided on the next frame 

We are going to call the same function on each new frame 

Move the rendering (not the size) inside the function 

function will look like this:

const tick =()=> {
    Time
    Update objects
    Render
    window.requestAnimationFrame(tick)
}

Clock is an THREE.js class 
const clock = new Clock();
With Clock, we can getElapsedTime();
