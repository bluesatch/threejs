Materials

write PlaneGeometry instead of PlaneBufferGeometry

Materials are used to put a color on each visible pixel of the geometries
The algorithms are written in programs called shaders

We don't need to write shaders and we can use built-in materials

See Materials in docs
MeshBasicMaterial => Most common

MeshNormalMaterial => can be used for lighting, reflection, refraction, etc

MeshMatcapMaterial => will display a color by using the normals as a reference to pick the right color on a texture that looks like a sphere

MeshDepthMaterial

MeshLambertMaterial

MeshPhongMaterial

MeshToonMaterial => looks cartoony
